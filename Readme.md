# Coding Assessment Level 2

This project is designed as a coding assessment for Level 2. It includes a responsive webpage that allows users to view and filter products by categories such as Men, Women, and Kids.

- **Dynamic Product Loading**: Products are fetched from an external JSON file hosted on Shopify's CDN.
